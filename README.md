# EnhanceX - Video & Image Quality Enhancer

EnhanceX is a web-based application that allows users to enhance the quality and resolution of videos and images directly in their browser. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience without requiring any server-side storage.

## Features

- **Video Enhancement**: Upscale video resolution, reduce noise, and improve overall quality
- **Image Enhancement**: Sharpen details, enhance colors, and increase resolution of images
- **Client-Side Processing**: All processing happens in the browser, ensuring privacy
- **No Storage Required**: Files are processed locally and never uploaded to any server
- **Customizable Enhancement Options**: Adjust resolution, quality, noise reduction, and color enhancement
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Google Fonts

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Users can upload video or image files by dragging and dropping or browsing their device
2. **Customize**: Users can adjust enhancement settings according to their preferences
3. **Enhance**: The application processes the media to improve quality and resolution
4. **Download**: Enhanced media can be downloaded directly to the user's device

## Limitations

- **Processing Power**: The quality of enhancement depends on the user's device processing capabilities
- **File Size**: Large files may take longer to process or may cause performance issues
- **Browser Compatibility**: Best experienced on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Future Improvements
